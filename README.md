# coursera-getting-cleaning-data

This repository contains the solution for the exam of the Coursera course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-032).

My steps are as follows:

1. Load the train and test data sets.
2. Load feature names and activities labels
3. Apply proper column names
4. Merge train and test data sets
5. Filter out the columns to keep only the relevant ones (subject, activity, std and means of all the features) 
6. Factor the activity values
7. Aggregate data and produce a tidy result data set

The CodeBook is available [here](CodeBook.md)
